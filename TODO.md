## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Profiler infrastructure and renderer profiling
2. **Medium Priority**: Core rendering optimizations and memory management
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced optimizations and nice-to-have features

## Notes
- Focus on measuring before optimizing
- Profile on target devices and browsers
- Consider both desktop and mobile performance
- Document performance improvements with metrics
- Test optimizations thoroughly to avoid regressions

## Profiler Integration Reminders
- **Cross-Tool Validation**: Always validate performance issues found by one tool with another (e.g., stats.js frame drops should correlate with spector.js WebGL call spikes)
- **Baseline Establishment**: Create performance baselines using multiple tools before making any optimizations
- **Report Correlation**: Ensure automated reports include data from all active profilers to avoid missing critical issues
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set up cascading alerts where issues detected by multiple tools trigger higher priority notifications
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain performance history across all tools to identify trends and regressions
- **Tool-Specific Strengths**: Use stats.js for frame timing, spector.js for draw calls, Chrome DevTools for memory, WebGL Insight for GPU bottlenecks
- **Development Integration**: Ensure profilers run automatically during development and CI/CD processes
- **Performance Budget**: Set performance budgets that are monitored by all profiling tools simultaneously
