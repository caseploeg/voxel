- Implemented texture atlas system that dynamically loads and packs textures into a single GPU-friendly sheet
- Set up basic FPS movement with PointerLockControls - WASD + Space/Shift for 6DOF navigation
- Added simple procedural voxel terrain generation with randomized heights and materials
- Got particle system working with basic physics (velocity, lifespan) and removal when expired
- Integrated Three.js post-processing pipeline with SSAO and bloom effects
- Configured proper lighting with ambient and directional light sources
- Established proper texture filtering (nearest neighbor for that crisp pixel look)
- Canvas-based HUD overlay positioned but not yet populated with data
- Input handling system working properly with keyboard events
- Set up proper animation loop with delta-time based movement for frame-rate independence
